summary: Provides a battery-efficient way to monitor a device's movement into or out of a geofence.
extends: Titanium.Module
description: |
    Your application is notified when the device moves into or out of a defined geofenced area.

    ## Getting Started

    Once you've added the Geofence module to your project, use `require()` to access it from JavaScript:

        var Geofence = require("ti.geofence");

    ### Creating and monitoring geofence regions

    You use the `[Geofence.createRegion()](Modules.Geofence.createRegion)` method to define a [Region](#region) object.
    A geofence is a circular area defined by a point (latitude and longitude) and a radius (in meters).

        var newRegion = Geofence.createRegion({
            center: {
                latitude:37.389601,
                longitude:-122.050169
            },
            radius:500,
            identifier:'Appcelerator'
        });

    To start monitoring a region, calll the `[Geofence.startMonitoringForRegions()](Modules.Geofence.startMonitoringForRegions)` method passing it the
    region or regions you want to monitor.

        Geofence.startMonitoringForRegions([region1, region2]);

    To be notified when the device moves into or out of a geofence region, create an event listener 
    for the `[enterregions](Modules.Geofence.enterregions)` or `[exitregions](Modules.Geofence.exitregions)` events, respectively. 
    For example:

        Geofence.addEventListener("enterregion", function(e) {
            // Display local notification
            for (var i = 0, j = e.regions.length; i < j; i++) {
                showNotification({
                    title: 'ENTER',
                    body: 'enter - ' + e.regions[i].identifier
                });            
            }
        })

    The event object passed to the `enterregions` event handler contains a `regions` property.

    ## Testing Geofence monitoring

    You have a few options to test geofence region monitoring in your application. One approach
    is field testing: travel (drive, walk, etc.) between monitored regions while the application is running
    on the device. You can also apss mock location data to the application. 

    Note: The timing and frequency of location events may vary from one environment to another (device, OS version, network availability).

    ### Mock locations from the iOS Simulator

    Once the application is running in the simulator, select the simulator and go to **Debug**>**Location** and 
    select a predefined location or route that you would like to be sent to the simulator. You can 
    also enter a custom location (latitude, longitude).

    ### Mock locations using Xcode

    This method will work on both the iOS Simulator and on device.

    1. Launch your application once, then go to the build folder of your project and open the Xcode project found in **build/iphone/**.
    2. Run your project using Xcode.
    3. Once app is running, in Xcode debug area, click the Simulate Location icon to display a list of mock locations that can be sent to your application.
    5. Select one of these locations to send it to your app. 
        Alternately, click on **Add GPX File to Project...** and select a GPX file with mock locations. A GPX file is provided in the **MockLocationData** folder in the <a href="apidoc_resources/ti.geofence/geofence-examples.zip">examples download</a>. The route starts at North De Anza Blvd and I-280 in Cupertino, CA and travels north on I-280.
    8. After adding a GPX file, go back and click on the mock locations arrow. The GPX file should now be in the list. Select the mock location to start using it.

    ### Mock locations on Android

    Add the following to your `tiapp.xml`.

        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION" />

    For more information, see [Testing Using Mock Locations](http://developer.android.com/training/location/location-testing.html) and 
    download the [LocationProvider](http://developer.android.com/shareables/training/LocationProvider.zip) application
    to send mock locations to your application.

    ### Sample applications

    <a href="apidoc_resources/ti.geofence/geofence-examples.zip">Download</a> a ZIP containing two Geofence sample applications (**Basic** and **RegionMonitoring**), and a GPX file for mocking location data in Xcode.

  - name: startMonitoringForRegions
    summary: Starts monitoring the [Region(s)](Modules.Geofence.Region) passed as a parameter.
    description: |
        Takes either an array of [Region](Modules.Geofence.Region) objects or a single
        [Region](Modules.Geofence.Region) object as an argument.

        On Android, if the device is located in a [Region](Modules.Geofence.Region) that has just 
        started being monitored, an `[enterregions](Modules.Geofence.enterregions)` 
        event is generated. On iOS, this scenario will not generate an `enterregions` event; 
        instead, use the `[containsCoordinate](Modules.Geofence.Region.containing)` on a `Region` object to check if a location is within a region.

        There is a limit to the number of regions that can be monitored at once per application; this limit is enforced by the platform.

        * iOS: 20 Region limit
        * Android: 100 Region limit

            Geofence.startMonitoringForRegions([region, region1]);
    parameters:
      - name: Region
        summary: Either an array of [Region](Modules.Geofence.Region) objects or a single [Region](Modules.Geofence.Region) object.
        type: [Array<Modules.Geofence.Region>, Modules.Geofence.Region]

  - name: stopMonitoringForRegions
    summary: Stops monitoring the specified region or regions.
